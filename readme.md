# Bnagla hand written document digiiztion

This repo addresses the problem of digiizing hand written documents in Bangla. Documents have definite fields of specific information. We target this area and crop this region.

We only focus on extracting amount information (in currency) which is important in tax return. Our approach first select characters and separates numbers from non-number characters. The final classification results of each character are merged to get full amount.
